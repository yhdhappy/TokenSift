# Design notes

Some thinking-aloud here. Some decisions may not make sense so they are explained here.

## Cost model

- `report.summary.cost` sums costs from each selected maximum savings finding and from costed findings with zero or negative token savings. It is undefined when no such cost contributor has pricing data. `atVolume` is included only when every cost contributor has an `atVolume` value.
- `token-sift pricing update` writes `.token-sift/pricing-overrides.json` instead of touching bundled data, since mutating `node_modules` is fragile and gets wiped on reinstall.
- Pricing ingestion (`pnpm pricing:update`) is a manual script, not a build step, since pricing goes stale on its own schedule, unrelated to releases.

## Anthropic estimate mode

- Gemini throws "not implemented" as it's not currently supported.
- Anthropic ships a real calibrated encoder, but only for models with a real measured calibration record (bundled or local). An uncalibrated Claude id throws rather than falling back to a rough guess.
- Calibration is keyed by exact model id, not provider family, in case tokenizer behavior ever diverges across Claude generations (as of now, it doesn't).
- The calibration math is a simple approximation, not a rigorous statistical fit, and it says so rather than pretending otherwise. Its real accuracy (`meanAbsPercentError`) is measured against actual samples and saved, not just assumed to be good.
- `token-sift calibrate anthropic run` is the only network call in the package, and only runs when that exact command is invoked.

## Why several rules look like they overlap

- `repeated-block` vs `duplicate-message-content`: one finds any repeated text, the other compares whole messages and names the role/index (catches a system prompt leaked into a user turn). Both kept.
- `repeated-block` skips a span whose every occurrence sits fully inside a JSON region, since the suffix automaton otherwise flags meaningless repeated punctuation across sibling rows, already `row-json`/`long-keys`'s job to describe.
- `redundant-structure` vs `repeated-block`: for a byte-identical duplicate, `repeated-block` already catches it. `redundant-structure` only earns its keep on a *reformatted* duplicate (pretty vs minified, same value, no shared literal text), since it compares parsed values instead of raw text.

## row-json / long-keys / verbose-schema-values

- `row-json` and `long-keys` are alternative strategies for the same waste (CSV/columnar vs short-keys-plus-legend), not independent savings. `totalWasteTokens` groups strictly-overlapping `loc.range` spans and keeps the largest claim per overlap group. Touching ranges remain separate and sum independently. The result is clamped to the input token count. Cost is aggregated from the selected group maxima plus costed zero-savings findings; `atVolume` appears only when every cost contributor has one. This conservative rule can undercount savings when overlapping fixes compose, such as `digit-fragmentation` on one timestamp inside an array `row-json` restructures.
- Known gap: `verbose-schema-values` reports the whole region's range (it's a cross-row pattern, not a per-field span), so it still collides with `row-json`/`long-keys` there even though it's actually composable with them.
- `findUniformObjectArrays` also checks a wrapped array (`{"actions": [...]}`, the standard shape for real tool-calling APIs), not just a bare top-level array, locating its exact source span, and stays scoped to this one service rather than `findJsonRegions` itself so `pretty-json` doesn't start double-firing on both an outer object and its nested array.

## Other rule notes

- `whitespace-run` only fires when collapsing a run actually saves tokens, since o200k_base merges whitespace efficiently enough that real hits need ~100+ chars, a narrower rate than "collapse messy whitespace" implies.
- `high-entropy-string` uses chars-per-token, not real entropy math, same as `uuid-bloat`, and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE enums sit right at that threshold from underscores compressing worse than prose, not from entropy, so they get a dedicated bypass.
- `findJsonRegions` skips empty arrays/objects (markdown checkboxes like `- [ ]` parse as one) and tolerates a literal unescaped newline inside a JSON string (common in hand-written multi-line notes, invalid per strict JSON grammar).
- `filler` lexicon is small on purpose, since judging tone edges toward judging prompt quality, which this project doesn't do.
- `dead-instruction` is regex plus proximity checks, not real reference resolution, cheap and conservative on purpose since false negatives beat false positives here.
- `unlabeled-dynamic` only fires on JSON regions, not "anything that looks dynamic" (a generic version is just `high-entropy-string` again).
- Several thresholds (`high-entropy-string`'s 3 chars/token, `repeated-block`'s 8-token minimum, `unlabeled-dynamic`'s 30-token minimum) are fit to OpenAI's tokenizer specifically, worth re-checking against Anthropic's encoder rather than assuming they transfer.

## applyFixes and JSON inputs

Byte-faithful for plain-string input, but for `Message[]`/`Payload` input `applyFixes()` works against a reconstructed joined string, so a fix range doesn't map back to real file bytes. The CLI's `--write` refuses `.json` input outright instead of guessing.

## CLI state (budgets, baselines, check)

- Baseline/budget values live in `.token-sift/baseline.json` / `.token-sift/budgets.json`, not in the rules themselves, so the same rule works whether the CLI or a library caller supplies the number.
- The 10% baseline tolerance is a hardcoded constant, not a config option, since nobody would tune it correctly without real drift data.
- `check` is a separate command from `analyze`, not a flag, so it can't accidentally grow `--fix`/`--write`/rule-override options later.
- `toMatchTokenBaseline` is keyed by test identity (`testPath > currentTestName`), since a snapshot-style baseline needs to know which test it belongs to.
- It skips CI-environment detection entirely, so the same input always produces the same result, on purpose.

## Provider profile

`AnalysisContext.providerProfile` has a typed shape but nothing populates it yet, since unverified numbers would be worse than empty.
